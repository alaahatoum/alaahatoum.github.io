								<!-- Project Story / Description -->
								<div class="project-description">
									<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
									<p>
										The Echo-Hand project began as an opportunity to explore robotics across all layers: mechanical design, hardware integration, and software control. Our team was particularly inspired by the potential applications of dextrous robotics for surgical procedures and remote operations, enabling doctors to reach and assist more patients across distances. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I started by fabricating an existing 3D-printable robotic hand design, carefully iterating on print orientations and material choices to reduce warping and optimize joint tolerances. I integrated the hand with a custom motor control and sensor suite, which allowed real-time gesture mirroring based on user hand movements. To make this possible, I built an OpenCV-based gesture recognition system on a Raspberry Pi to process live camera input and interpret hand motions, while an Arduino Uno ran a PID-based control system to actuate the servo motors precisely.
									</p>
									<p>
										Along the way, I resolved mechanical misalignment issues by redesigning servo mounts and linkages, and troubleshot friction and binding by adjusting joint clearances and testing different lubricants. Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with software, biomedical, and mechanical engineers to ensure the hand's motion was smooth, accurate, and reliable. This experience gave me hands-on insight into the full robotics development lifecycle and demonstrated how integrated design across disciplines is essential for creating functional, dextrous robotic systems.
