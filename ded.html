								<div class="project-description">
									<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
									<p>
										The Daedalus Maze Solving Rover was conceived to explore fully autonomous navigation, object detection, and retrieval capabilities in a dynamic maze environment. Our team challenged ourselves to design a system that was not only fast and versatile but also robust, capable of completing complex tasks reliably in real-world conditions.
									</p>
									<p>
										We implemented an Omni-Wheel X-Drive configuration to maximize maneuverability and speed, allowing the rover to translate and rotate in any direction without turning. This choice pushed our mechanical and control systems to handle sophisticated motion planning and real-time obstacle avoidance simultaneously.
									</p>
									<p>
										I contributed by programming the Arduino microcontroller in C++ to manage PID-based control for brushless DC motors, integrating ultrasonic sensors and an IMU for precise localization and navigation. I also fabricated and iterated on mechanical components using 3D printing, laser cutting, and machining to support rapid design improvements. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Beyond hardware, I led debugging and validation efforts across mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems. I developed a wireless communication link between the sensor suite and central controller, reducing onboard computational requirements while maintaining accurate position tracking. Field testing in various maze layouts allowed us to iteratively improve performance, speed, and reliability.
									</p>
									<p>
										This project taught me the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration and rigorous iterative testing. It also gave me hands-on experience with advanced autonomous control systems, real-time sensor integration, and precision mechanical design in a fully integrated robotics platform.
